 * Themeable widget kit: a palette-driven set of reusable Phaser 4 UI factories (buttons, rows,
 * badges, panels, progress bars, backgrounds) sharing one visual language — a dark fill, a
 * crisp colored stroke, and (where noted) two wider/fainter strokes behind it standing in for a
 * glow. That "layered-alpha-strokes glow" technique needs no shader/Bloom postFX pass (works
 * identically under the Canvas fallback too) and is reused everywhere below instead of being
 * reinvented per widget.
 *
 * Every widget takes its accent color as a parameter (or falls back to `getTheme()`'s current
 * palette) — nothing in this file hardcodes a specific game's colors. A new game reskins the
 * whole kit with one `setTheme({ colors: { ... } })` call, ideally before any scene creates its
 * first widget. See CLAUDE.md's "UI Kit" section for the full theming guide.
